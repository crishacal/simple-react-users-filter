# React application with user and avatar search

A simple user list application that loads data from a public API (JSONPlaceholder), allows searching by name, email, username, or phone number, and displays each user in a "card" with a dynamically generated avatar. It's a classic example of a React app with data fetching, real-time filtering, and interactive elements.

## Technologies used

- React: A library for building user interfaces
- Vite: A quick build tool for React projects (replaces Create React App in many cases)
- React Hooks: useState to manage state and useEffect for side effects (such as data fetch)
- External API: JSONPlaceholder for simulating real data without your own backend
- Avatar Generation: We use the UI Avatars service for placeholder images based on the user's name

## Prerequisites for running

- Install Node.js
- Download the project and run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Start with `npm run dev` — the app opens in the browser at localhost:5173 (Vite's default)
